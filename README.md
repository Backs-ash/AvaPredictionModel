# AvaPredictionModel

AvaPredict is a neural network that utilises past spatial data around multiple
sub-sections, analyses variables and outputs the possible geo-location and the
probability of an avalanche occuring in and around that location. The model is
<ins>xxx%</ins> accurate based on the training and testing data provided to it.

### Datasets utilised

---

We have extracted data from <ins>so and so</ins> resources. The data is then
normalised and run through an extractor to process the pixels in the neural net
with ease.

### Propose pipeline

---

The data gets fed to a U-net[link:https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet]
based neural network. The usage of this particular network is supported by a
research conducted by Filippo Maria Bianchi et al.

# AvaPredictionModel

AvaPredict is a neural network that utilises past spatial data around multiple
sub-sections, analyses variables and outputs the possible geo-location and the
probability of an avalanche occuring in and around that location. The model is
<u>xxx%</u> accurate based on the training and testing data provided to it.

### Datasets utilised

We have extracted data from <u>so and so</u> resources. The data is then
normalised and reduced to process the pixels with ease.
